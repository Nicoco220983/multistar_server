__MultiStar__ is a webserver, written in node, hosting local multiplayer games.

"Local multiplayer" means that all the players of a game play on the same screen in a same room, each with their own joypad. I believe that this "old-school" way of playing multiplayer games is more funny and friendly.

The joypads can be nothing more than a smartphone, connected to the game joypad webpage. Thus, no specific hardware is required, as almost everybody today has a smartphone.

## Run the server

```
npm start
```
